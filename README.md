# Authorization Server (Dev)

Centralized authorization server using OAuth-server through Laravel and Laravel Passport as an abstraction or bridge layer. It implements broadcasting using [Echo Server](https://gitlab.com/elyerr/echo-server) and [Echo Client](https://gitlab.com/elyerr/echo-client-js).

This server was developed to facilitate the creation of microservices applications that can easily connect to the main server as if they were a unified system. With this authentication and authorization server, you can develop microservices or monolithic applications in any programming language and database manager. This enables developers to build applications in the language they are most proficient in, allowing for the creation of more complex applications.
